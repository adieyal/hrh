<em>Recurrent expenditure:</em>
those operations and maintenance expenditures needed to run the
project at a level consistent with its expected use, and to maintain
the capacity of the investment during its expected lifetime.

<h1>How do I know…?</h1>
<h3>Estimating the costs of scaling up and their affordability</h3>
<p>
  Producing more health workers requires more training, strategic
  marketing and recruiting, remunerating more educators and trainers,
  and additional infrastructure (laboratories, classrooms,
  dormitories) financial resources and equipment. There are two
  categories of costs that need to be considered in planning the
  expansion of the health workforce. First, there are the costs of
  expanding training capacity, which are a mix of capital costs for
  additional infrastructure and equipment, and recurrent costs for
  staff salaries and operating costs. Second, there are the costs
  associated with the employment of an expanded workforce, which are
  largely recurrent.
</p>

<h3>Where will the money come from?</h3>
<p>
  The issue of the source of financial resources will be addressed
  differently in accordance with the level of wealth of a
  country. Options available to policy-makers are: (i) to use existing
  public revenues, by shifting resources within the health or
  education sectors, for instance from costly hospital services to
  education, or from other sectors to the education of health
  professionals; (ii) to look for efficiency gains, for instance by
  increasing the utilization of mid-level and community workers, by
  reducing attrition (GHWA, 2008:72), and by making savings in the
  current educational system to increase its productivity; (iii) to
  generate revenue through higher taxes; (iv) to mobilize private
  funds through fees paid by students or creating incentives for the
  opening or expansion of private educational institutions, which are
  largely funded by student fees; (v) a combination of the former.
</p>

<h3>Where should the money go?</h3>
<p>
  Spending more is important, but spending better is even more
  so. Funds should be used to increase the quantity, quality and
  relevance of health workers and thereby have the highest impact on
  the type and volume of services that the country needs. This is an
  issue of efficiency in the allocation of available funds: in what
  proportion should the funds be allocated to training physicians (and
  among them specialists or family practitioners), nurses and other
  technical personnel, or community workers?
</p>

<h3>How to ensure a flow of funds that makes scaling up sustainable?</h3>
<p>
  it is suggested that countries prepare a series of plans with both
  long-term or prospective timeframes, and short-term or operational
  timeframes. The training plan should be consistent with the human
  resources for health plan, which in turn should be consistent with
  the health sector plan. This plan should set out health improvement
  objectives and the strategies by which they would be achieved,
  including the respective roles of public and private sector actors,
  and should be compatible with the predicted available resources,
  both capital and recurrent.
