<p>Scaling up your stock of human resources for health must be done
  with a clear understanding of the national goals and objectives for
  the health system and for health services as the juncture between
  the health system and the population.  An essential step of an HRH
  planning exercise is to make the most of the existing health workers
  through ensuring that they are adequately deployed, highly
  productive, delivering quality care and are retained within the
  health service.  The following questions all highlight
