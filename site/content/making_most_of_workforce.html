<p>
  Training new health workers is expensive and takes time.  Before
  committing to production of additional health workers, it is
  important to ensure that the existing health workforce are deployed
  in the right way (geographically, across different cadres),
  performing well, and that there are not unemployed health workers or
  issues with retaining existing health workers.  The following
  questions are designed to assess whether you are making the most of
  existing health workers.  Click on the questions below for more
  detail, or on the following buttons once you have made your
