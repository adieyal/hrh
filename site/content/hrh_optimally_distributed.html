  The following questions are designed to assess whether distribution
  of your current health workforce is appropriate.  Click on the
  questions below for more detail, or on the buttons above once you
  have made your assessment.

<h2>Definition of geographic distribution</h2>
<p>
  The following is taken from the WHO Global Health Observatory
  <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/indicatorregistry/App_Main/view_indicator.aspx?iid=112" target="_blank">registry
  of indicators</a>.  ‘Methodologically, there are no gold standards
  for assessing the sufficiency of the health workforce to address the
  health care needs of a given population. It has been estimated
  however, in the <a href="http://www.who.int/whr/2006/en/" target="_blank">World
  Health Report 2006</a>, that countries with fewer than 23
  physicians, nurses and midwives per 10 000 population generally fail
  to achieve adequate coverage rates for selected primary health care
  interventions as prioritized by the Millennium Development Goals
  framework.’
