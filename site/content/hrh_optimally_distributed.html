  The following questions are designed to assess whether distribution
  of your current health workforce is appropriate.  Click on the
  questions below for more detail, or on the buttons above once you
  have made your assessment.

<h2>Definition of geographic distribution</h2>
<p>
  The following is taken from the WHO Global Health Observatory
  registry of indicators.  ‘Methodologically, there are no gold
  standards for assessing the sufficiency of the health workforce to
  address the health care needs of a given population. It has been
  estimated however, in the World Health Report 2006, that countries
  with fewer than 23 physicians, nurses and midwives per 10 000
  population generally fail to achieve adequate coverage rates for
  selected primary health care interventions as prioritized by the
  Millennium Development Goals framework.’
