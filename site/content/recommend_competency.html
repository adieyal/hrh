<p>
  <strong>Health professionals’ education and training institutions
  should consider adapting curricula to population needs through
  identifying and defining the core competencies that are required to
  meet the evolving needs of their populations.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Key considerations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    regularly review and update core competencies.
  </li>
  <li>
    regularly review curricula and programme delivery to determine if
    the programme prepares students to attain the core competencies
    needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    resistance to curriculum change can occur; significant changes may
    have implications on faculty who may be uncertain of new
    understanding and practices, and will need to take into account
    issues of timelines for the rollout and faculty development.
  </li>
  <li>
    establishing or working with existing institutional structures
    including community placements for learning.
  </li>
  <li>
    continuous evaluation.
  </li>
</ul>
