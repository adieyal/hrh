<p>
  The selection and recruitment of qualified educators and trainers is
  a crucial part of the scaling up and transformation of the education
  of health professionals. Recruited staff should have adequate
  clinical and scientific competencies, but they rarely have the
  pedagogical preparation (communication, adult learning principles,
  use of new information technology, etc.) required to function in the
  transformed environment.  Faculty development is, therefore,
  important to ensure that teachers and trainers are well prepared to
  assume their responsibilities as educators.

<h2>Definitions:</h2>
<p>
  <em>Faculty development:</em> a planned programme of events aimed at
  preparing individuals for their roles as teachers, clinicians,
  researchers and administrators with the purpose of enabling the
  institution to meet its goals, vision and mission, and its social
  and moral responsibilities to the communities it serves (Frenk, et
  al., 2010; Couper, et al., 2012)
</p>

<h2>How do I knowâ€¦?</h2>
<p>
  The following issues will influence the availability of qualified faculty/trainers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Most health educators are expected to fulfil dual roles of
    clinical practitioner and teacher</strong>, and thus have at least
    two challenging sets of competencies to acquire.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is evidence that, <strong>in most countries, educators of
    health professionals are insufficiently prepared as teachers and
    trainers</strong>, even though their clinical knowledge and skills
    may be good. Their capacity to prepare future professionals for
    evidence-based practice, interdisciplinary team work, or
    management and leadership is often deficient. There is however,
    little evidence on how to prepare health professionals for their
    new roles.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Faculty development programmes can be an asset in
    recruiting and retaining teachers</strong> as they offer valued
    professional development opportunities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Faculty development should cover key areas</strong> such
    as clinical teaching, small group facilitation, large group
    presentations, feedback and evaluation, personal and
    organizational development, leadership and scholarship, and change
    management.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Strategies and formats for faculty development</strong>
    can include continuing education activities, be work-based or
    classroom-based, face-to-face, via the Internet or
    tele/videoconferences, self-learning, mentorship and communities
    of practice, or a combination of all of these. Whatever the
    strategy, organizational structures and mechanisms should be
    created or developed to support its implementation.
  </li>
</ul>
