<p>
  This framework is aimed at, “identifying key factors that affect a
  school’s ability to positively influence health outcomes and health
  systems performance and to develop ways to measure them across
  institutions and contexts.”  It addresses issues that are related to
  transforming health professional education, i.e. by ensuring quality
  and relevance, although it is interpreted through the lens of social
  accountability.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Framework is designed to be used in its entirety, as schools
    may vary widely in their approach across different contexts. In
    addition, it is intended to be used on an institution-wide basis
    not at department or program levels. Moreover, for the Framework
    to be effective and so that its findings be acted on,
    institutional buy-in at highest levels is essential.

<h2>Examples of implementation</h2>
<p>
  To date, five of the founding THEnet schools have pilot tested the
  Framework (ADZU, FLINDERS, JCU, NOSM, and SHS). Each of these
  schools found the Framework effective, not only in evaluating the
  school's progress towards greater social accountability, but also in
  raising awareness of the issue among students, staff and
  stakeholders. It allowed each school to review their schools’ social
  accountability mission, vision and goals and identify strengths,
  weaknesses and gaps.
