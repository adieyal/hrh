<h2>Description of tool</h2>
<p>
  The WISN method is a human resource management tool. It provides
  health managers a systematic way to make staffing decisions.  The
  method determines the number of health workers required to cope with
  the workload of a given health facility and assesses the workload
  pressure of health workers.  It enables answers to the following
  questions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How many health workers  of a particular cadre do I need in a certain health facility</li>
  <li>Are health workers deployed based on demand for health service?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Support from senior directors & managers with responsibility for
    HRH decisions, and commitment from other stakeholders (eg
    professional associations and unions)
  </li>
  <li>
    Clarity on why you want to use the WISN method and for what
    decisions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Annual workload statistics that are of acceptable quality and up
    to date.
  </li>
  <li>
    Resources 
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>How long does it take</h2>
<p>
  Depending on the scope of the WISN implementation exercise, it could
  take from 6 months to a year or more to implement the process in
  full.
