<p>
  Over the past century, the demographic, epidemiological,
  socioeconomic and technological environment has changed dramatically
  with increasingly complex and new demands on the health professional
  workforce.  Curricula need to be adapted to produce professionals
  with the capacity to identify and adjust to new environments in a
  continuous process of learning and adapting their
  competencies. Health professionals must be able to adapt to cultural
  variations and values, as well as attitudes to the different health
  problems of populations.
