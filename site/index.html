<p>The Health Workforce Diagnostic Framework (HWDF) is a user-focused
  resource designed to help policy makers and practitioners understand
  and solve their problems relating to health workforce availability,
  accessibility, acceptability and quality.  It aims to operationalise
  and promote the accessibility of the WHO’s Health labour market
  framework and policy levers for attaining universal health coverage
  (UHC).  It also seeks to provide the ‘missing middle’ between health
  workforce themes and the vast array of relevant tools, resources and
  guidelines that exist.  It provides a flexible platform that can be
  adapted in response to user feedback and emerging issues.  Please
  contact Erica Wheeler
  (<a href="mailto:wheeler.erica@gmail.com">wheeler.erica@gmail.com</a>)
  if you have any feedback or suggestions on how the HWDF could be
  improved.</p>
